This script calculates and compares the percentage change in gold prices between a given current price and the prices from the past five days. The main components of the script include two functions: calculate _ percentage _ change and compare_ gold_ prices. The calculate _ percentage _ change function computes the percentage difference between the current and past gold prices, while the compare _gold _ prices function iterates over a list of past prices to evaluate the price change for each of the last five days. The script uses a set of simulated past gold prices and compares them with the current gold price, outputting the percentage change for each day. This approach can be applied in financial analysis, particularly in tracking the short-term fluctuations in commodity prices like gold. The script demonstrates how Python can be leveraged for price comparison and analysis in the context of market trends.
